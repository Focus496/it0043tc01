            <p class="description">Kiryu is the stoic dreamer of the dark yakuza world, living by a strict code of honor and a very strong sense of justice. He does not judge others and is generally accepting of anyone who is friendly towards him. He is a good listener, giving advice in response to his environment rather than seeking out conversations.</p>

            <p class="description">Majima is a resourceful, charismatic, and commanding man. He has gained the respect of friend and foe alike, often due to his ferocity and skill in combat. He is also a successful businessman and is surprisingly pragmatic, as shown by his success with The Grand and Club Sunshine, and later his construction company, Majima Construction.</p>

            <p class="description">Saejima is exceedingly blunt, and is never one to beat around the bush in a conversation. This can lead to him sounding harsh or pessimistic, but his words are usually meant with the best of intentions. </p>

            </div>

            <p class="description">Akiyama is a lackadaisical, yet kind person. He is always ready to help people in need, commonly putting the city's residents' needs over his own. Despite his occupation as a loan shark, he selectively lends out his money free of interest and collateral; instead, he gives unique tests to his clients before he loans them money to determine if they are truly in need of the money. He will sometimes help them accomplish their tasks if it is within his power to do so. He will not hesitate to turn down his clients if they fail his tests, though he is not opposed to second chances. </p>

            <p class="description">Date is an extremely busy and intelligent police detective, who is quickly capable of detecting lies and contradictions in testimonies. He also gives a helping hand to any victim of criminal conspiracies, regardless of their background, and is a family man, in spite of admitting to neglecting his wife and daughter. Despite his proper and clean image, Date is willing to rebel against the police establishment if he believes that they are interfering with the achievement of justice. </p>
